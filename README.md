# [Project 1: Targetted ad project](https://github.com/lanreakinosuntoye/targetted_ad_project)

A data science project of the Information and Data Analytics Foundation (IDAF) for a targetted advertising firm, to build a predictive model to forcast the likelihood that a customer will click on an ad sent to them. The aim eventually, is to increase the Click Through Rate (CTR) of campaigns. 
This was achieved by analysing and training a machine learning algorithm on customers' historical data for personalised ad targeting. The model was also deployed to docker and Amazon web services.
